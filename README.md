Alberta AI Assistant ü§ñ is an innovative Telegram bot designed to enhance the cybersecurity of server nodes through AI-driven analysis and secure server management. By scanning ports, detecting vulnerabilities, and offering actionable solutions, the bot aims to provide seamless protection for IT infrastructure.

This project leverages the ```SUI blockchain``` and integrates with the ```Atoma LLM models``` to create a robust solution that generates vulnerability reports directly within Telegram. Additionally, it uses the ElizaOS framework to configure an agent with Atoma keys within the SUI plugin.

The project takes on a significant challenge‚Äîsecuring server nodes in real time through AI‚Äîand aims to offer a comprehensive, automated solution for vulnerability scanning, with real-time recommendations.

## üöÄ Features

1. **Port Scanning**: Scans server nodes for open ports
1. **Vulnerability Detection**: Detects known vulnerabilities on servers and provides recommendations.
1. **Telegram Integration**: Summarizes vulnerabilities and solutions in easy-to-read summaries via Telegram.
1. **SUI Wallet**: Integration with SUI wallet for secure interactions and transactions.
1. **USDC Transactions**: Facilitates USDC transfers for resolving vulnerabilities (To be implemented).
1. **Scanning Tools Used**:

- **Nmap**: A powerful tool for network discovery and vulnerability scanning, used to check open ports and identify services running on a server.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

The bot currently handles scanning and vulnerability detection. Integration with ```SUI wallets``` and transaction handling (such as sending USDC) is under development.

The bot is built using the ```ElizaOS``` framework, ensuring maintainability and scalability. The implementation follows best practices for blockchain integration and Telegram bot development.

The integration of ```Atoma LLM provider``` for generating vulnerability reports within Telegram is a unique and innovative application of AI for real-time security reporting. The use of SUI blockchain for secure wallet management and transactions adds another layer of sophistication.

Host scanner tool **Nmap** is a powerful tool for network discovery and vulnerability scanning, used to check open ports and identify services running on a server.

## üåü Agent setup

Node v23 is required to run the agent (```nvm install 23.3.0```).

1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alberta-ai-assistant.git
cd alberta
```

2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm clean && pnpm install && pnpm build
```

3. Start agent

```bash
pnpm start
```

[DEV mode] Start agent in debug mode

```bash
DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL=debug pnpm start --dev 
```

## Planned Features

1. **SUI Wallet Integration**: Users will be able to connect their SUI wallet to the bot, allowing for secure transactions and interaction.
1. **Automated USDC Transactions**: The bot will automatically send USDC from its wallet to Atoma to resolve any identified vulnerabilities.
1. **Expanded Vulnerability Database**: Continuous improvement of the AI‚Äôs vulnerability detection capabilities, expanding beyond open ports.
1. **Token Usage and LLM Cost Calculation**: The bot will calculate the costs associated with using the Atoma LLM for generating reports and provide this information to users.
1. **User Feedback**: The bot will prompt users for feedback and ratings of the scan results.
