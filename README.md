# Alberta AI Assistant overview (Sui Agent Typhoon Hackathon)

<img src="docs/pics/alberta-bot.jpg" alt="Alt text" width="100" height="100" /> 


Alberta AI Assistant ü§ñ is an innovative Telegram bot designed to enhance the cybersecurity of server nodes through AI-driven analysis and secure server management. By scanning ports, detecting vulnerabilities, and offering actionable solutions, the bot aims to provide seamless protection for IT infrastructure.

This project leverages the ```SUI blockchain``` and integrates with the ```Atoma LLM models``` to create a robust solution that generates vulnerability reports directly within Telegram. Additionally, it uses the ElizaOS framework to configure an agent with Atoma keys within the SUI plugin.

The project takes on a significant challenge‚Äîsecuring server nodes in real time through AI‚Äîand aims to offer a comprehensive, automated solution for vulnerability scanning, with real-time recommendations.

## üöÄ Features

1. **Port Scanning**: Scans server nodes for open ports
1. **Vulnerability Detection**: Detects known vulnerabilities on servers and provides recommendations.
1. **Telegram Integration**: Summarizes vulnerabilities and solutions in easy-to-read summaries via Telegram.
1. **SUI Wallet**: Integration with SUI wallet for secure interactions and transactions.
1. **USDC Transactions**: Facilitates USDC transfers for resolving vulnerabilities (To be implemented).
1. **Scanning Tools Used**:

- **Nmap**: A powerful tool for network discovery and vulnerability scanning, used to check open ports and identify services running on a server.
- **Nuclei**: A fast, template-based vulnerability scanner that helps identify known security flaws in the server configuration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

The bot currently handles scanning and vulnerability detection. Integration with ```SUI wallets``` and transaction handling (such as sending USDC) is under development.

The bot is built using the ```ElizaOS``` framework, ensuring maintainability and scalability. The implementation follows best practices for blockchain integration and Telegram bot development.

Innovation: The integration of ```Atoma LLM provider``` for generating vulnerability reports within Telegram is a unique and innovative application of AI for real-time security reporting. The use of SUI blockchain for secure wallet management and transactions adds another layer of sophistication.

### Tools options

- **Nmap**: a powerful tool for network discovery and vulnerability scanning, used to check open ports and identify services running on a server.
